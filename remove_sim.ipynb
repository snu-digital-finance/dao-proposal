      "in scp-80, shapeshift product workstream leader diggy made the case for data analytics to inform our path to product market fit, and the proposal passed snapshot at the beginning of june. pendo was formally integrated with the shapeshift app at the start of q3 2022, and the product and marketing workstreams started tracking data on our product features for those who have opted in to sharing anonymized in-app action data. in addition to pendo, the two workstreams will continue to explore ways to pull on-chain data as well as structure and synthesize in-depth in-app data to give us new and more comprehensive insights with the goal of improving our product, messaging, marketing, and business development strategies.\n",
      "this proposal is intended to address the issue of privacy as it relates to tracking user data and actions both on and off the app. the product and marketing workstreams recognize and respect the role of privacy in the ethos of the shapeshift dao. we would like to work with the community to establish a working definition for privacy that can be used to enhance operational efficiency within the workstreams of the dao with the goal of using this definition to improve the efficiency of delegated decisions.\n",
      "abstract\n",
      "if this proposal passes, the dao will have successfully established an operative meaning for privacy that can empower workstreams to make autonomous decisions while remaining within the bounds set by the community. this definition would negate the current need to pass a governance proposal each time the product or marketing workstreams intend to test a new type of user behavior through data tracking for the purposes of improving user features and constructing effective marketing funnels as long as the feature or strategy falls within the bounds of the definition. if these powers were ever abused and/or used in such a way as to concern the community, the dao can amend the working definition established by this proposal to narrow its scope appropriately.\n",
      "motivation\n",
      "the primary motivation for this proposal is to increase efficiency of decision making related to the application of user data tracking within the shapeshift app. developing high-performing product features and marketing campaigns is a unique challenge in web3, as there is a de facto expectation of data pseudonymity. in addition, the dao is committed to offering a private version of our app that does not include any analytics or tracking. as a result, we are looking for creative ways to gather and synthesize the data necessary to determine answers to the key questions raised by diggy in scp-80\n",
      "a clear definition of privacy and subsequent delegation of related decision making to the product and marketing workstreams would improve our ability to develop data gathering strategies required to answer these questions.\n",
      "specification\n",
      "the proposed working definition for privacy is as follows:\n",
      "data privacy means the ability of a user to determine when, how, and to what extent their personal information is shared with others as well as how that data is correlated with other trackable/metricisable events inside and outside the application.\n",
      "as mentioned above, shapeshift currently maintains a private version of its app so users can opt out of data collection entirely. this option ensures the dao offers a version of the product that guarantees complete data privacyupholding the most extreme interpretation of no tracking/no data collection.\n",
      "importantly, the definition of data privacy above will be used to create a framework for data privacy decisions related to users who login via app.shapeshift.com.\n",
      "data tracking details:\n",
      "data: anonymized click-throughs and user journey\n",
      "the previous proposal explicitly excluded sending hashes of users' public keys. this proposal seeks to update that to permit tracking of anonymized data for the purposes of product improvement.\n",

      "asset ids belonging to public keys\n",

      "hashes are unique and not reversible - this does not enable us to deanonymize a user from hashed data back to public keys.\n",
      "private keys, or encrypted or hashed versions, never have or will be tracked.\n",
      "when: user data is collected from the moment a user enters app.shapeshift.com and agrees/opts in to sharing anonymized user data. mobile app users are tracked as part of the terms of service.\n",
      "no personal identifiable information will ever be tracked.\n",
      "how and to what extent:\n",
      "analytics will track anonymized click events within our app for the purpose of understanding user retention rates, which features our users adopt, identifying drop offs or potential issues in our user flows, and to generally understand how users navigate throughout our application. we may sometimes also use an analytics tool to run anonymous surveys or polls with our users, to help inform product decisions or gather feedback. in some cases it could also be used to identify the parts of the world our users are in and how they first entered the shapeshift ecosystem. this information will be used to help us with seo, user acquisition funnels and marketing strategy.\n",
      "on-chain tracking will respect the pseudonymity of user wallets, and utilize analytics for critical business tasks such as building complete marketing funnels, feature planning, feature utilization and verifying partner revenue reporting.\n",
      "the anonymized data collected via the shapeshift app will be available through the analytics provider/s and analytic platform access will be granted to relevant workstream contributors and shared during calls or office hours with the community.\n",

      "never have access to users private keys nor collect any personal information\n",
      "never collect a users ip address\n",
      "never sell user data\n",
      "never gate features for users that opt-out of sharing data\n",
      "benefits\n",
      "defining privacy and allowing product and marketing workstreams to explore various data collection strategies will allow these workstreams to further measure the success of our products leading to better feature engagement, higher user retention and finding the best product market fit. this definition will give parameters for workstreams to operate so that the core values of the daosuch as privacycan continue to be scrupulously upheld while giving workstreams the agency to operate effectively within those confines.\n",
      "users will continue to have the option to opt-in to sharing data or choose to proceed with the complete private version that collects no data of any kind.\n",
      "drawbacks\n",
      "giving workstreams the agency to implement tracking within these confines means that the broader community will have less jurisdiction over the specific tools implemented by workstreams in the future to collect, synthesize, and aggregate data. as long as the strategy falls within the bounds set by this proposal, a workstream would have the authority to execute on it.\n",

      "r/ethtrader recently started doing weekly contests, to promote community engagement and incentivize the creation of original content. these contests happen over the course of the distribution round, with one new contest happening every week. a member oversees and organizes these contests, and receives a reward in donuts for their efforts.\n",
      "this proposal aims to ensure these contests continue in a fair, balanced, and meaningful way, by balancing the prize pools and ensuring donuts come from the ideal source of funds.\n",
      "problem\n",
      "to make the contests a permanent piece of ethtrader, funds need to be allocated to reward both the monthly organizer and the winners.\n",
      "extracting these funds from the current distribution allocation would mean everyone as a whole earns less donuts, potentially decreasing activity and discouraging overall content creation. many users may have no interest in participating in these contests, and should not be penalized by earning less collectively.\n",
      "additionally, the distribution allocation has went through several changes recently. to assess whether donuts are being fairly distributed and in a balanced way, time is needed to collect and analyze the data. changing the allocation again, right after it was recently changed, would not allow us to do such an assessment.\n",
      "also, this would require the developer responsible for the donut dashboard to change the distribution allocation once again, consuming time and effort.\n",
      "solution\n",
      "to ensure the viability of these contests, making sure the organizer and winners receive their rewards, without penalizing other contributors who do not wish to participate, i propose that the rewards come from the community treasury.\n",
      "the purpose of the community treasury is to fund initiatives that benefit ethtrader and the donut ecosystem. these contests are part of such initiatives.\n",
      "currently, a monthly allocation of 255k donuts goes to the treasury, which is more than sufficient, considering there is already a substantial amount in the treasury and reasonable fund management over the years.\n",
      "i propose to allocate 50k donuts out of the monthly share of 255k donuts from the distribution as follows:\n",
      "10k donuts to the organizer (fixed or rotating monthly basis)\n",
      "5k donuts to the first place\n",
      "3k donuts to the second place\n",
      "2k donuts to the third place\n",
      "additionally, i propose an equal ratio of contrib to be awarded to all those involved:\n",
      "10k donuts + 10k contrib to the organizer\n",
      "5k donuts + 5k contrib to the first place\n",
      "3k donuts + 3k contrib to the second place\n",
      "2k donuts + 2k contrib to the third place\n",
      "note: this would be based on a weekly basis (except for the organizer's share).\n",
      "an alternative suggestion would be to promote these contests on a monthly basis instead, distributing the rewards as follows:\n",
      "25k donuts + 25k contrib to the first place\n",

      "the distribution allocation stays unchanged, not negatively affecting those who don't wish to participate.\n",
      "ensures fair use of the community treasury for initiatives that benefit the entire community.\n",
      "disadvantages\n",
      "contests can be susceptible to manipulation, like users contacting voters to vote for their submissions, or using alt accounts with 20k governance weight to vote for themselves. also, determining winners in contests that involve creativity or subjective criteria might lead to disagreements and complaints from participants who feel their efforts were undervalued.\n",
      "rewarding these contests continually might impact the perceived donut value if not carefully managed, possibly affecting market dynamics.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "this proposal makes sure that weekly contests continue on r/ethtrader, without interfering with the distribution allocation. thereby we wouldn't penalize the remaining contributors. this proposal would also put the community treasury to good use, rewarding initiatives that benefit the ethtrader and donut ecosystem.\n",
      "please note that the purpose of this proposal is to address the funding source and ensure the contests' viability in terms of rewards. details such as who will be the organizer, contest rules, or voting factors are not related to this proposal and can be dealt with in a different post, proposal, or contest thread.\n",

      "moonbeam is the de facto defi hub for polkadot. blue chip defi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to moonbeam, including sushiswap, lido, curve, chainlink and covalent. as the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying uniswap v3 will position it to become a premier amm on moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire polkadot ecosystem. this represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for lps and uni token holders.\n",
      "the nomad team has worked on this proposal because [nomad and connext]( have already been deployed as moonbeams main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from ethereum into moonbeam. by deploying uniswap v3 on moonbeam, nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for uniswap governance.\n",

      "decentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the uniswap ecosystem. as uniswap labs highlighted in their post about [multichain uniswap]( it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of uniswap. the moonbeam community already uses [nomad]( and [connext]( to bridge erc-20 tokens from ethereum; despite moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35m tvl is currently bridged to moonbeam via nomad, with over $250m in total volume since deployment. however, nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and uniswap v3 deployed on moonbeam can leverage nomad for governance.\n",
      "we have worked with developers at uniswap labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for uniswap]( deployments. it became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. this problem will multiply as uniswap is deployed to more chains.\n",
      "nomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. nomads own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app]( built on its arbitrary message passing rails. this application can be [tailored]( for the purpose of governing uniswap deployments on chains other than ethereum mainnet. rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, moonbeam.\n",

      "- *expansion into polkadot*: uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the polkadot ecosystem. moonbeams evm-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using xcm. by leveraging xcm and moonbeams position as the defi hub for polkadot, uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier amm across polkadot.\n",
      "- *trust-minimized governance*: per uniswaps goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using nomads trust-minimized channels to deploy uniswap v3 on moonbeam. this can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other v3 deployments in the future.\n",
      "- *rewards for uniswap grants program*: instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with uniswap. we will commit $2.5m to the uniswap grants program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand uniswaps multi-chain presence.\n",

      "in cooperation with dma labs (a major contributor to ichis uniswap v3 management protocols ( and support of furthering the vision of multichain uniswap 15, we propose that the uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of uniswap v3 to boba network.\n",
      "boba network is a blockchain layer 2 scaling solution and hybrid compute ( platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective layer 1. bobas hybrid compute brings the power of web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\n",
      "in addition, boba network is the first and only multichain ( layer 2, deploying on leading layer 1 chains such as ethereum, avalanche, bnb and moonbeam. deploying on boba will expand the uniswap community to include users of the boba multichain ecosystem, helping uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n",

      "we believe there are many benefits for the uniswap protocol, some of which include:\n",
      "ethereum equivalence. developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by ethereum are already supported on boba network. a trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from ethereum to the boba network l2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as across.to, synapse, multichain and layerswap.\n",
      "low cost transactions with high security. as an ethereum l2, boba network relies on ethereums strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than ethereum.\n",
      "details for incentivized adoption of uniswap v3\n",
      "boba network will provide $1m $boba tokens to foster the usage of uniswap v3 on boba network. the tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the uniswap grants program (ugp) and boba network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:\n",
      "the incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of uniswap v3 such as ichi, perpetual protocol, paraswap, or 1inch. the $boba can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. anything increasing the usage of uniswap v3 on boba network, including building new applications on top of uniswap v3, should be supported. the goal is to deploy the $1m in the time period of one year. funds not used after two years would go back to boba. the spending is limited to $1m - the transferred amount of $boba as part of the proposal. boba network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. in addition to this, boba network has already contributed more than $4m of liquidity on uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of uniswap v3 on the boba network.\n",
      "security\n",
      "boba network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on l2 and l1. users can relay messages themselves. the security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. bridging and sequencing transactions is based on optimisms optimistic rollup codebase. from l1 to l2, users need to trigger the canonicaltransactionchain contract on l1 to create a new block on boba network. our sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on l2. from l2 to l1: making provable statements about the state of boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the boba's state trie to a smart contract on l1 called the statecommitmentchain. we regularly publish updates of the state trie. with merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on boba at a specific block height. this can then be used to enable contracts on boba l2 to send messages to contracts on l1.\n",
      "the bridge uses the security of the source chain (l1). in an optimistic rollup design, state commitments are published to l1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the challenge window). in the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. fraud proof challenges are not enabled and theres a single sequencer design currently in production. in the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.\n",
      "the boba network codebase and optimisms codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.\n",

      "2024-09-01 13:03:08,601 [INFO] [[2]] : motivation/rationale:\n",
      "when the acx token first launched, the infrastructure for across protocol governance was just forming and not ready for the community; however, there was an immediate need for better liquidity in the token. instead of using its multisig signing rights on the across dao treasury and enforcing a decision to use dao assets, [risk labs]( decided to front its own acx tokens to incentivize liquidity with the hope that it would be reimbursed in the future.\n",
      "starting on december 8, 2022, risk labs deposited a bribe to [aura finance]( via [hidden hand]( of 150,000 to 300,000 acx each epoch (every 2 weeks) to drive emissions to the [wsteth / acx pool]( on balancer. a total of 2.3mm acx was deposited for this purpose. the acx was transferred from the [risk labs multisig]( to an [eoa]( that executed the transactions. all bribe transactions are summarized and can be verified in [this table]( in addition, risk labs locked its own holdings of bal and eth to receive vebal and has been using that to further boost emissions in the wsteth / acx pool via [gauge voting]( the combination of the two have helped to create a liquidity pool that is over $1mm in value and has greatly benefited acx token holders.\n",
      "now that across protocol has [deployed osnap]( and optimistic governance is in place, the across dao treasury should reimburse risk labs for this 2.3mm acx. the across dao has the ability to take ownership of this process to control and execute these bribes as a community. risk labs will continue to support the across dao to ensure acx liquidity remains healthy and will assist the dao in setting up this process.\n",
      "the current set up of osnap is not ideal for directly depositing bribes into aura for the following reasons:\n",
      "1. the across dao treasury would need to interact with an external smart contract which has a tail risk of exposing the protocol and its assets.\n",
      "2. the current osnap parameters are purposely set to be conservative in the initial stages with a 7 day snapshot voting period and a 3 day dispute window to validate transactions using the uma optimistic oracle. this is a long time frame given the 2 week epoch for bribes. the intention is to reduce these windows as acx token holders become more familiar with osnap.\n",
      "3. with the current rules set in the module, acx token holders would need to vote every 2 weeks to approve a bribe. the ideal set up would be one vote to designate an entity like risk labs to spend a certain amount to directly execute bribes on hidden hand. this would require some design work and a change in the rule set.\n",
      "over the next few weeks, risk labs will work with the across community to design a process that efficiently implements the desired outcome without putting the dao treasury at risk and burdening acx token holders.\n",

      "this proposal consists in pulling 100k usdc from the protocol surplus and swap these usdc into paxg. this can be done with a minimal slippage on-chain (or otc with market makers having access to deeper paxg-usdc liquidity than whats on-chain).\n",
      "following this swap, the proposal aims at giving a minting right to the angle governance address on the aggold stablecoin, and then to mint the same number of aggold stablecoins as paxg obtained. liquidity will then be added on a curve aggold-paxg pool to be created upon aggold deployment (need contract address).\n",

      "this proposal would expose the protocol to a risk of loss if the  value of gold was to decrease. indeed the usdc used to buy paxg from the protocol surplus come from the ageur surplus and as such a decrease in the value of the paxg bought would decrease the value of the surplus that can be used to ultimately protect ageurs peg.\n",
      "in addition, minting aggold in a pool with paxg is equivalent in backing the minted aggold with paxg. and so this proposal (like the proposal below) creates some dependency on paxg for the protocol. if paxg was to depeg, then aggold would most likely depeg as well.\n",

      "the major risk for the proposal is essentially the risk mentioned above of creating a too big dependency to paxg for aggold.\n",
      "it comes as well with a smart contract risk (mitigated though by the fact that the smart contract infrastructure to be used has been in prod for ageur for several months now).\n",

      "a curve pool is essential to maintain the stability of aggold. yet to further connect aggold with on-chain liquidity, it makes sense to bootstrap other pools for it.\n",
      "ageur is already a connector token for routes involving euro stablecoin trades. it should be straightforward to add is as a connector token across different chains.\n",
      "proposal is to mint 50k ageur, the corresponding value of aggold, and add full range liquidity to a univ3 pool ageur-aggold with 0.3% fees.\n",
      "this would be done through the governance multisig of the protocol.\n",
      "2024-09-01 13:03:08,743 [INFO] [[6]] : risks\n",
      "this is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. it indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. if the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted ageur and aggold with providing liquidity with them.\n",
      "the amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. the bigger the volume the smaller the loss.\n",
      "we have built [an impermanent loss simulator]( to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation.\n",
      "if the price of gold was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. as such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal.\n",
      "intent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of xau/eur price variations. if impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then ageur and/or aggold might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins.\n",
      "the estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow ageur-aggold liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that itd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period.\n",
      "note that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain ageur and aggold. at the exception of this amo, ageur and aggold will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. this amo is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use ageur surplus to compensate for a potential aggold bad debt coming from this amo (or conversely). apart from this, we propose to keep ageur and aggold as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. if scaled, the size of this amo should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time.\n",

      "Message: '[[6]] : risks\\nthis is potentially the proposal for which the risks are harder to caliber. it indeed exposes the protocol to a risk of impermanent loss on both sides. if the  value of gold was to increase or decrease, the protocol would lose with respect to the strategy that consists in holding the minted ageur and aggold with providing liquidity with them.\\nthe amount of loss made by the protocol would very much depend on the range of the gold price variations and on the volume on the pool. the bigger the volume the smaller the loss.\\nwe have built\\xa0[an impermanent loss simulator](\\xa0to be able to estimate in which circumstances how much this proposal would cost to the protocol in the worst situation.\\nif the price of gold was multiplied or divided by 2 (which is usually far more than the gold volatility in a year), the protocol would lose 6% of its initial portfolio. as such, in a pessimistic scenario for the protocol (no volume, big price variations), the protocol would lose 6k out of this proposal.\\nintent with this proposal is to start with relatively small amounts with respect to what the protocol can support ($100k maximal loss with respect to $8m support), and potentially scale up if historically volumes and fees made on the pool are sufficient to offset the impermanent loss that appears out of xau/eur price variations. if impermanent loss get too big with respect to the surplus for the protocol, then ageur and/or aggold might end up in a situation of bad debt where there are unbacked stablecoins.\\nthe estimated cost of the proposal is to be put in parallel with the incentives that it would cost to grow ageur-aggold liquidity to the scale desired. 6k a year is potentially a smaller cost than the amount of incentives that itd cost to maintain around 100k of liquidity for the time period.\\nnote that the intent of this proposal is still to maintain ageur and aggold. at the exception of this amo, ageur and aggold will be fully independent stablecoins with different backing mechanisms and segregated surpluses. this amo is the only point in common between the two stablecoins, and we propose to use ageur surplus to compensate for a potential aggold bad debt coming from this amo (or conversely). apart from this, we propose to keep ageur and aggold as completely independent stablecoins, such that if one fails, the other is unimpacted. if scaled, the size of this amo should be properly calibered in order not to pose a threat on the two stablecoins at the same time.'\n",

      "after extensive discussion in the discord and last community call, we are calling on the aladdin and f(x) community members to share their opinion about a potential expansion of the f(x) stablecoin strategy to include a dollar-pegged coin in addition to feth. we refer to this as a beta0 coin, whereas feth is a beta0.1 coin. this is a complex question with a lot of implications, so the team has tried to boil it down to a few broad options for discussion.\n",
      "the community should keep in mind that this is all in service of our high level mission:  *to use the f(x) mechanism to create the deepest liquidity decentralized stablecoin in defi*. given that, this change should be viewed completely through the lens of:\n",
      "-   (1) growing tvl (and liquidity) for our stablecoin(s)\n",
      "-   (2) maximizing adoption now and in the future\n",
      "a few high level points regarding fusd:\n",
      "-   the f(x) model easily and simply supports beta0;\n",
      "-   fusd will offer the strongest peg mechanism in defi as it is always pegged to $1 mathematically. the pegging mechanism is also reinforced by trading activities as the stable token can be arbitraged both ways;\n",
      "-   any f(x) pool offering fusd would require slightly more conservative stability mode thresholds; cr133 instead of cr130. this means we need slightly more xeth to support the same quantity of stablecoin;\n",
      "-   there are two ways to implement this; either fully isolated with its own reserve and its own x token, or expand the current feth model to a 3-asset system, where both feth and fusd are volatility-controlled, and xeth continues to absorb all uncontrolled volatility from the reserve.\n",
      "important side note:\n",
      "-   f(x) will very soon be rolling out new f/x pairs for yield bearing defi tokens. for these pairs, the fxxx tokens will have beta0 so in fact f(x) will be launching 0-beta tokens, however defi tokens have lower liquidity, and these are meant for farming rather than scaling. this discussion is about a second scale-worthy stablecoin to complement feth.\n",

      "-   fastest to launch, simplest; technically possible with no further code;\n",
      "-   isolated risk (esp. regulatory) between fusd and feth.\n",
      "cons:\n",
      "-   creates a second xeth (xxeth?) which will diverge from first in both nav and leverage at any given time, potentially confusing users, fragmenting liquidity on x side;\n",

      "-   does not preclude doing fusd later. moreover, one long term possibility is a factory pool system that would allow permissionless creation of pairs with arbitrary reserve token and beta.\n",
      "in the end, all users seem to be aligned that the discussion must center around maximizing sustainable adoption and growth, measured by tvl. does usd-pegged stable availability or specific mechanism dilute narrative of f(x) or feth more than it benefits? there doesnt seem to be much argument in the community about whether fusd is a good thing to have or not; most seem to think we should offer it sooner or later in some form, but the decision about whether we implement it right now and how must be based on what we think can sustainably drive tvl growth, given the tradeoffs (practical, narrative, regulatory) discussed.\n",

      "this proposal is intended to acquire a total of 100k grt (graph tokens) to stake them, allowing us to operate our own graph network node. running our own node makes us less dependent on third-party nodes, improving the stability and performance of our nftx.io front-end.\n",
      "secondary effects of staking grt are potential yields generated by others using our indexing & query processing services. the acquired grt tokens will be part of the nftx dao balance sheet.\n",
      "funds used to acquire grt will be raised from the partial sale of our existing xsushi balance.\n",
      "2024-09-01 13:03:14,031 [INFO] [[2]] : rationale\n",
      "the nftx marketplace uses the graph to query data that powers the front end including the vaults, holdings, and prices. the site currently uses a shared hosting solution for these requests which is being phased out by the graph in favor of decentralized solutions. whenever these endpoints become unavailable, the data required to display the vaults, nfts, staked positions, and coins are unavailable. while we have a caching layer to help, the cached version is stale and wont necessarily reflect the current status of the blockchain.\n",
      "by creating a graph indexer and being part of the decentralized infrastructure we can ensure that we always have an endpoint available for our front-end product requirements and avoid any potential downtime for the users of our app. we will also be providing a query endpoint for anyone who wants to build other products upon the nftx protocol making this easier to set up. finally, we will be contributing to the wider community because along with the nftx subgraph we will be indexing sushi exchange, eip721, and eip1155 subgraphs which other non-related projects can use to support their products.\n",
      "while this could be considered philanthropic, staking the grt against these subgraphs and contributing to the decentralized nodes will be earning grt from other graph users and provide an additional revenue stream for the dao. initially, the pricing for use will be targeted towards covering the infrastructure costs of the nodes and reviewed in the future if additional revenue should be incorporated into the cost of queries.\n",

      "blueberry is a new multi-step aggregator that enables lenders to earn passive income while borrowers are able to take advantage of on-chain leverage into their preferred yield strategy. blueberry would like to partner with alchemix and create custom strategy vaults for alchemix related pools. blueberry asks its partners to seed a lending deposit of their own tokens, and in exchange will integrate strategies in the ecosystem for leveraged deployments.\n",
      "if the proposal succeeds, the alchemix community will be able to earn low risk passive income by lending, or take more risk to earn high yields with leverage.\n",

      "2024-09-01 13:03:16,641 [INFO] [[2]] : proposal\n",
      "we propose that the alchemix dao makes a treasury deposit of $500k worth of alcx on blueberry lend [ (url not yet live, test deployment in progress).\n",
      "blueberry will allow borrowers to borrow the tokens to enter custom automatic yield strategies, and will also support leverage into various pools for the assets.\n",
      "this creates a new revenue stream for the treasury or other holders who do not wish to take any additional price risk by providing liquidity or locking their tokens. the treasury providing this liquidity will allow for the community to add leverage to their deployments.\n",
      "setting up a blueberry lending market adds a source of passive yield for ecosystem token lenders that pays far higher market rates than they would receive on aave or compound (projected blueberry rate  5-10%). all yield comes from borrower interest + bblb emissions, net adding a significant amount of yield to the alchemix ecosystem.\n",
      "if the dao decides to make a treasury deposit, blueberry dao will direct boosted bblb emissions to the pool to create an additional yield. estimated to be worth $20k over 2 months, which translates to a 24% apr on a deposit of $500k. after 2 months, the additional bblb rewards are targeted to add a 3-5% bonus apr.\n",
      "if this proposal passes, blueberry is willing to enable the alasset curve pools (alusd3crv, alusdfraxbp, alethcrv) as possible strategies for borrowed assets, usdc, dai and eth. this incentivizes additional deposits into the main alasset pools at no cost to alchemix.\n",
      "blueberry also makes it possible to insure the alcx deposits at a very low annualized interest rate of 2% through sherlock. given that blueberry (while thoroughly audited) is a new protocol, purchasing this insurance would be highly advised and is the default option should the proposal pass.\n",

      "this enables the alchemix treasury to earn on its dormant alcx without directly impacting the price of alcx (the spells would require users to supply an equal amount of usdc/etc. to the amount of alcx that they borrowed, thus the alcx is not sold in the process). with the recent withdrawal from tokemak, none of the treasury alcx is currently deployed anywhere. the initial proposed deposit of $500k worth of alcx is ~5% of the current treasury alcx holdings.\n",

      "sushi remains the primary platform for trading radar in a decentralized manner on ethereum, ensuring reduced slippage and substantial liquidity depth. although radar is available on centralized exchanges, sushi plays a crucial role in allowing anyone to easily participate in the dappradar ecosystem, bypassing centralized players. to maintain and potentially increase the current liquidity on sushi, the rewards offered to liquidity providers (lps) who stake their lp tokens must be sustained. therefore, we propose continuing to reward lps and preserving a healthy ecosystem.\n",

      "since the last proposal focused on extending the sushi lp rewards (dcp-7 6), numerous positive developments have emerged within the ecosystem. the product has evolved, the 2023 roadmap was published, valuable partnerships were formed, and radar was listed on significant centralized exchanges. however, the importance of liquidity on decentralized exchanges remains high.\n",
      "presently, the radar-eth pool tvl on sushi is $1.43m, which facilitates efficient trades given the average trade size in the pool. this was demonstrated in february when over $4.20m in trade volume was achieved in a single day on sushi alone. this indicates that the current liquidity maintains a stable position and readies us for future growth.\n",
      "as mentioned in previous proposals, we will continue exploring various alternatives to attract and maintain liquidity in radar pools across all chains. there has been some progress in researching potential solutions to decrease liquidity costs and transition from rented liquidity (e.g. sushi - ethereum) to protocol owned liquidity (e.g. apeswap - bnb chain).\n",

      "Message: '[[19]] : welcome to defi wars. an upgrade of lp wars, now with staking vaults. this is yet another important chapter of kalmy.app ecosystem.\\nwithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate defi ecosystem empowered by nft, we are introducing a new low risk defi product for kalmy  a liquidity and staking layer for all quality bnb projects (if tests are success \\xa0we dive into more chains).\\nthis v2 kalmy product is a combination of yearn finance, curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user\\'s safety. on one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for lps and vaults. an example would be a pancake or biswap lp that gets cake/bsw rewards auto-compounded with kalm rewards on top.\\nanother example is cake for cake single stake with kalm rewards on top.\\non another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the kalm rewards on top of cake/bsw or cake single stake pool are decided by the vote results. it is important to note that any quality lp/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no cake/bsw/bake/other rewards), could start earning kalm just with voting.\\noverall, the protocol itself also reviews a solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. this as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project\\'s leads.\\nin kalmy defi wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. on top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. as always, locking kalm gives more voting power (the calculator is available on kalmy.app, more locks info is as well available in docs).\\nit is also important to notice that kalmyswap is an amm aggregator. this means that initially all new and current lps would be allocated on pancakeswap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both kalmyswap and pancakeswap  effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\\nhere is a bit more of the introduction:\\ndefi wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of kalm token on its road to deflation.\\ncommunity  please, keep sharing the word. projects that are early  don\\'t miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass fomo kicks in.\\nlet\\'s amplify the fun once again, shall we?'\n",

      "it is assumed that changes proposed in this proposal will benefit cow dao by increasing access and removing choke points for posting snapshot proposals. it will also reduce exposure to changes in the snapshot space settings by limiting root access to the cow dao safe itself.\n",
      "this will be done by removing all snapshot admins, making cow dao's safe the [sole admin]( that can change the cow.eth snapshot space settings, by way of onchain transaction to change the `snapshot` text record. this will remove the risk of snapshot setting being changed by a single admin without authorization from the dao.\n",
      "it is proposed to set 10k cow voting power score as defined by cow.eth snapshot space voting strategies, as the minimum threshold holding to post a new proposal on snapshot. this will allow anyone holding that amount to post new proposals in the snapshot space, making the technical governance process more inclusive and open.\n",
      "as seen in other snapshot spaces (for example gnosis.eth) this approach sometimes results in spam proposals or proposals that do not comply with the governance precess requirements. in order to mitigate this problem, it is proposed to add community `moderators` who will have the power to filter such proposals as needed, mitigating spam or non-complying proposals who might be submitted by any cow holder with the required holding threshold.\n",
      "to clarify, snapshot space moderators can only add and remove proposal but don't have access to any other action on the space including settings changes.\n",

      "this proposal is a temperature check for the addition of a mstable strategy to element finance built on top of the save product\n",
      "paragraph summary\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "a couple of months ago, was initiated a discussion with the element team about how mstable and element finance could partner to create a fixed-rate market on top of mstable save & the musd asset\n",
      "motivation\n",
      "----------\n",
      "element finance currently supports multiple vault strategies. the apy for most of them is highly reliant on the market bonanza. on the flip side, mstable save (because of the plurality of its yield sources, especially its embedded amm fees) is market-agnostic and produces a highly resilient yield\n",
      "creating a fixed-yield market on top of save would offer an additional layer of resiliency, highly appreciated by long-term-oriented depositors, looking to lock in capital for a duration of>1 year. we believe this user class is of value for element and is relatively underserved at the moment.\n",
      "beyond this, mstable alongside element, are early adopters of the erc-4626 standard drastically improving the composability of defi yield-bearing vaults.\n",
      "save has recently been upgraded to be erc-4626 compliant, the integration work of the vault shall be minimum.\n",
      "more generally, the benefits would be:\n",
      "-   consistently strong apy\n",
      "-   long-term depositors attraction\n",
      "-   trustless and battle-tested contract\n",
      "-   erc-4626 compliant integration\n",
      "more generally, we would love mstable save to be part of the element finance ecosystem.\n",
      "in the last few months, mstable has been heads down building a generalisable, composable and market-reactive multi-vault architecture powered by the erc-4626 standard.\n",
      "also, we closely followed element deployment on aztec connect. mstable is very close to the aztec team and is working on integrations on their network as well.\n",
      "specification\n",

      "musd is 1:1 backed by its underlying basket\n",
      "the basket is constantly arbitraged through musd native amm. each asset within the basket has a set of max and min weights. currently, these are set to 5% and 50%. this means that no single asset could make up more than 50% of the basket nor less than 5%. this is to limit exposure to a single underlying asset in the unlikely case of a depeg.\n",

      "mstable deposits 98% of musd's underlying assets to established money markets to earn a base interest rate. this rate is then further increased by distributing mstable swap fees and liquidating external protocol incentives.\n",

      "-   59.5% to compound\n",
      "if we break down save apy, 55% of it comes from lending interest revenues on aave & compound, 22.5% from our amm swap fees & the remaining 22.5% from platform rewards liquidation. it would mean that 25% of save's yield is independent of lending protocol and their inherent risk. save apy is hence fully organic, market-neutral and ultra-consistent.\n",

      "-----------------\n",
      "balancer finance allows for the rehypothecation of liquidity provider assets into yield-bearing strategies via its asset manager functionality. its flagship proof of concept is the aave-boosted pool, which deploys usdc, dai, and usdt into aave in accordance with its trading volumes. this allows for higher yields and reduces the opportunity cost present in underutilized stableswap pools.\n",
      "in parallel to this development, not only has balancer finance implemented its vebal system, but aura finance has also committed to subsidizing governance-favored balancer pools. this means that bb-a-usd lps can receive i) trading fees, ii) rehypothecation yields, iii) $bal emissions, and iv) $aura emissions. accordingly, yearn finance has developed a strategy capable of a) depositing bb-a-usd balancer pool tokens into aura finance, and b) auto-compounding the position as it earns $bal and $aura.\n",
      "motivation\n",
      "----------\n",
      "bb-a-usd represents the second largest pool on balancer finance with $140m in tvl (between two pools) at the time of writing. it typically deploys between 80 and 85% of its liquidity into aave, implying a blended 0.71% yield with current lending rates. factoring in both $bal and $aura emissions, this comes out to ~6.5% apr prior to any auto-compounding executed by yearn finance. as an originator, it presents a compelling combination of organic yield as well as consistent governance token emissions.\n",
      "furthermore, we at fiat dao see a clear win-win-win opportunity for ourselves, element finance, and balancer finance should bb-a-usd come to be supported. we would look to add support for principal tokens as collateral for minting $fiat, which has liquidity primarily on balancer finance via our \"[fud]( pool. users would be able to leverage their exposure to the bb-a-usd pool, resulting in locked tvl for both balancer and aura. if that strategy proves popular, we believe balancer and aura governance would have an incentive to subsidize $fiat liquidity in order to increase the strategy's capacity.\n",
      "the end state of such a scenario playing out would be:\n",
      "-   recurring tvl for element\n",
      "-   greater interest in secondary liquidity for $fiat\n",
      "-   locked tvl for balancer, aura\n",

      "rfp-32 seeks approval from radiant dao stakeholders for the planned deprecation of dai as a supported asset in radiants money market on the arbitrum chain. this proposal is in response to the observed stagnation and limited utility of the dai market within our platform on arbitrum.\n",
      "2024-09-01 13:03:20,371 [INFO] [[2]] : motivation\n",
      "the decision to propose the deprecation of dai in radiant's arbitrum money market is underpinned by several key observations and data-driven insights:\n",
      "1. *declining reserve value:* since the launch of radiant v2 in march 2023, there has been a notable decline in dais cumulative reserve value within radiant. the reserve value has decreased from $26m to $2.48m, reflecting a significant drop in its utilization and relevance in our ecosystem.\n",
      "2. *comparative market share:* the current reserve value of dai constitutes only about 0.54% of our total reserve markets. this minimal share further emphasizes its dwindling significance in comparison to other assets in our portfolio.\n",
      "3. *decreased user relevance:* the usage trends and feedback indicate that unstaked dai has become increasingly irrelevant to our user base. this shift in user preference and activity underscores the need for a strategic realignment of our asset offerings.\n",
      "4. *resource optimization:* by phasing out dai, radiant can redirect its resources and focus toward markets that demonstrate higher activity and growth potential. this realignment is crucial for staying responsive to the changing demands of our users and maintaining a competitive edge in the dynamic defi landscape.\n",
      "this proposal seeks to proactively adapt to these market changes, ensuring that radiants offerings align with the interests and needs of our community while contributing to the protocols overall efficiency and growth.\n",
